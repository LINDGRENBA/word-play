# Word Play

#### jQuery, Javascript and Looping Exercise for Epicodus, 05.08.2020

#### By Brittany Lindgren

## Description

The purpose of this project is to use javascript, jQuery and forEach and Arrays to take a user's sentence, place it into an array, select only those words which are three characters or more and then create a new array from those words. The program will then reverse the array and return the result to the user in the form of a new sentence (or in this case, a poem).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository.
* To view the code itself, open in a text editor such as VS Code or Atom, etc.
* To view in your browser, double click on index.html.
* You do not need to run a server to view this document.

## Known Bugs

If the user places a period at the end of their sentence, the period is returned in the new sentence, attached to the same word (if that word meets the requirements to be returned). Requires update to remove period from the original sentence when words are placed into an array.
